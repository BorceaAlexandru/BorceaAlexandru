# Hi, I'm Alex! 👋

I’m a third-year Systems Engineering student at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, focused on Embedded Systems and IoT. I enjoy building reliable solutions where software meets hardware — from low-level C/C++ control to real-time, sensor-driven projects. I’m always curious to learn, experiment, and share what I build with the community.
